# Mathy_Stuff

# This repo will have short code with math-related stuff.

# It could have conversions, calculations, or matplotlib graphing 
# scripts that I learn things with or feel it is useful for others
# to reference.

# The py files most likely will have a "testing" section at the bottom
# The testing section may or may not have the testing code commented out.
